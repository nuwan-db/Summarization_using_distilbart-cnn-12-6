If the new delta reduces the variance of your hedged portfolio versus the pure local vol model , then it means that the introduction of stochastic vol has resulted in a better description of market dynamics versus the pure local vol model.  \n",
       "Secondly, what you also find is that you can have different models all of which reprice the vanilla options, but that some exotic options have very different prices in the different models.  For example , the introduction of stochastic vol can be done in a way that preserves the vanilla option prices , but it lowers the value of forward implied volatilities in the model versus a simple local vol model. Thus, exotics that depend on forward vols ( cliques, Bermudan etc) are priced very differently.  Hence another reason to introduce stochastic vol is to improve the pricing of exotics, given the vanilla market.  \n",

If $B$ is the value of the basket then VIX value at expiration is $\\sqrt{ B }$. Then VIX futures price is the expectation of the basket $VIX _{F} = E[\\sqrt{ B }]$. Delta of the VIX futures price with respect to the basket would be $$\\ \\frac{\\partial VIX _{F}}{\\partial B} = \\frac{\\partial E[\\sqrt{ B }]}{\\partial B}$$\n",

So \"use the chain rule and linearity of the derivative\" approach would not get you anywhere. But that does not mean that such derivative is 0. Such derivative can be calculated in Malliavin sense, but that is probably not what you're looking for.  \n",

Option-adjusting the spread makes an equivalence between everything theoretically possible, but the quality of results depends significantly on the quality of your interest rate model and its calibration.  My personal opinion, though, is that the results need to be treated carefully because the OAS model does not (typically) include stochastic credit spreads and potential capital structure changes, and therefore tends to underprice the embedded options.\n",
       "For a bond with a single call date, Delta would be the risk-neutral exercise probability, but that situation is nearly nonexistent.  Since the interest rate model used for OAS can easily compute the exercise probability alongside valuation, you should just use the model to get it.\n",

       "Depending on the application, using data dating farther back than 10 years may be impractical and undesirable for many reasons -- de-listed stocks, regime changes, etc.  In fact, risk management applications often require covariance estimations over recent periods of time (1-3 years).\n",

If the new delta reduces the variance of your hedged portfolio versus the pure local vol model , then it means that the introduction of stochastic vol has resulted in a better description of market dynamics versus the pure local vol model.  \nSecondly, what you also find is that you can have different models all of which reprice the vanilla options, but that some exotic options have very different prices in the different models.  For example , the introduction of stochastic vol can be done in a way that preserves the vanilla option prices , but it lowers the value of forward implied volatilities in the model versus a simple local vol model. Thus, exotics that depend on forward vols ( cliques, Bermudan etc) are priced very differently.

Your strategy will involve first finding out if the stocks are co-integrated; if they are then you will need to have a strat like:\n \n- If the spread (C - P) > threshold then sell C and buy P\n- If the spread (C - P) < threshold then buy C and sell P\n \nThe idea here is that if the spread widens say C increases then eventually P will also increase or C will eventually revert to some long running value.\n \nThe key challenge here is to determine when the spread is at its optimal value, so that you know when to enter / exit the trade\n \nVery quick and basic, there are tons of info on this strat on the web.\n",

         "Well, what you find is that the introduction of stochastic vol changes the delta of your options.  So what does this mean? If the new delta reduces the variance of your hedged portfolio versus the pure local vol model , then it means that the introduction of stochastic vol has resulted in a better description of market dynamics versus the pure local vol model.  \nSecondly, what you also find is that you can have different models all of which reprice the vanilla options, but that some exotic options have very different prices in the different models.  For example , the introduction of stochastic vol can be done in a way that preserves the vanilla option prices , but it lowers the value of forward implied volatilities in the model versus a simple local vol model. Thus, exotics that depend on forward vols ( cliques, Bermudan etc) are priced very differently.  Hence another reason to introduce stochastic vol is to improve the pricing of exotics, given the vanilla market.  \n",

         "The answer to your first four questions is affirmative.  Option-adjusting the spread makes an equivalence between everything theoretically possible, but the quality of results depends significantly on the quality of your interest rate model and its calibration.  My personal opinion, though, is that the results need to be treated carefully because the OAS model does not (typically) include stochastic credit spreads and potential capital structure changes, and therefore tends to underprice the embedded options.\nFor a bond with a single call date, Delta would be the risk-neutral exercise probability, but that situation is nearly nonexistent.  Since the interest rate model used for OAS can easily compute the exercise probability alongside valuation, you should just use the model to get it.\nIf you are not computing OAS yourself, you are probably working with pretty pathetic numbers because most commercial sources are poorly calibrated (I'm looking at you, Bloomberg).\n",
